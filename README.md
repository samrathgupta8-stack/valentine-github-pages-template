# Valentine iPhone-Friendly Website 💘

A cute, mobile-first Valentine mini-website you can host **for free** using **GitHub Pages**.

## Demo
Your live link will look like:

- `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`

## Features
- iPhone-friendly layout (big buttons, clean spacing)
- Fun 'No' button interaction (makes 'Yes' bigger)
- Online date planner (choose a vibe + day)
- Food + dessert picker
- Final recap page
- **Copy our plan** button (lets the person copy their answers and send them to you)

## Quick start (local)
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customize (edit 1 file)
Open **`config.js`** and change:
- `partnerName`
- `nickname`
- `dateOptions`, `foodOptions`, `dessertOptions`
- `finalButtonText`

You can also replace:
- `cat.gif`
- `hug.gif`

## Deploy free with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo
2. Upload all files in this folder (make sure `index.html` is in the repo root)
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. **Source**: Deploy from a branch
5. **Branch**: `main` — **Folder**: `/ (root)`
6. Open your published link

Tip: after edits, refresh your site with `?v=2` to bypass caching.
